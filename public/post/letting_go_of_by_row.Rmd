Wat?

Just when it seemed like I was getting the hang of this `purrr` thing, I started noticing these messages appear. WHY HADLEY? WHY?! 

Well if you read the `purrr` [NEWS.md](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/master/NEWS.md), it sounds like Hadz was unhappy with the dependency profile of `purrr`. And in that light, slimming down the package makes complete sense. I can't be the only one who has shied away from using it in package development because of the depenencies brought along for the ride. These include `dplyr`, `lazyeval`, and `rcpp`.

So while I get the thinking here, I was dissappointed that I couldn't find any clear examples about how I should replace `by_row` and `invoke_rows` with the suggested functions. The rest of this post attempts to document a few useful examples.

#by_row for nest, mutate, map
