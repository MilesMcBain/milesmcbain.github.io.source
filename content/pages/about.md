I am Research Associate at [Queensland Univerity of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/) and a Visiting Scientist at the [CSIRO Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/). I work on applied statistics problems with industry partners as well as meta-projects that aim to make data analysis easier. My work interests are R, data wrangling, the discipline of reprodicble analysis, forecasting from simulations, and visualisation in AR/VR.

In my spare time I help organise the Brisbane Users of R Group (BURGr), and have put on 2 R unconferences is Brisbane.

The best way to get my attention is to tag [@milesmcbain on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain).
